# Status

Currently this a Work in Progress. Please take a look in the "issues" tab to join discussions, and help with ideas and things. Feel free to open new issues with questions of discussion points on the overall project. We also have a slack for day-to-day discussions.

# Goals

The current goals of the AssemblyScript project are:

* Target feature parity with WebAssembly and related technology.

* Stay as close to TypeScript syntax and JavaScript APIs as reasonable.

* Support non-browser use cases well (i.e. serverless, blockchain, etc...).

* Compliment current web projects, and support building WebAssembly modules "from scratch". By offering "fine-grain" control to developers.

* Focus on developer experience, and try to be a great language for new and existing web developers. 

# Team

Currently a WIP.
