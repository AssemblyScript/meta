# Goals

The current goals of the AssemblyScript project are:

* Target feature parity with WebAssembly and related technology.

* Support non-browser use cases well (i.e. serverless, blockchain, etc...).

* Stay backwards-compatible to TypeScript syntax and JavaScript APIs as much as possible and reasonable.

* Complement current web projects, and support building WebAssembly modules "from scratch". By offering "fine-grain" control to developers.

* Focus on developer experience, and try to be a great language for new and existing web developers. 

# Governance

Following the [definitions described in opensource.guide](https://opensource.guide/leadership-and-governance/#what-are-some-of-the-common-governance-structures-for-open-source-projects). The Governance for the project is split into two parts:

## Technical Decisions

Technical Decisions can be interpreted as contributions being made to projects in the AssemblyScript Github Org.

For this, we will be following BDFL. Daniel Wirtz (@dcodeIO) is the designated lead. Thus, in the case there is conflict between contributors, the lead will be the one to make the final decision.

## Organizational Decisions

Organizational Descisions can be interpreted as contributions to the general project direction, goals, roadmap, maintainers, etc...

For this, we will be following a meritocracy. Where consensus will be requested on issues opened on this repo to get a community vote, and can find a path going forward.

## Teams

The AssemblyScript project members is divided into teams. The teams make design, architectural, and new-membership decisions for their relevant domains and repositories by consensus. If consensus can't be made, then the Compiler team (specifically @dcodeIO) may act as a tie-breaker. 

**Membership guidelines**:

* Anyone who is making significant contributions to the project (whether it be code, documentation, outreach, their own awesome project, etc...) is welcome to join the communitty and request to join a team! :)

* Membership does not require any required responsibilities outside of general activity in the communitty. The project is open source and contributions are made at one's own accord. So help when you can. If things get busy on a member's end, that is okay! We welcome back all awesome contributors back after a haitus.

* All members of a team must adhere to the [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

* Membership does not grant commit access to a repository. Commit access should be handled by the author of the repository, or by consensus of the respective team.

### Compiler

The "Compiler" team works on the AssemblyScript compiler and its standard library. Mostly, under the [AssemblyScript/assemblyscript](https://github.com/AssemblyScript/assemblyscript) repository.
