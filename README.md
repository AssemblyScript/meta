# Goals

The goals of the core team are (approximately in this order):

* Target feature parity with WebAssembly, providing fine-grained control over its feature set.
* Stay reasonably close to TypeScript (JavaScript) and their APIs to offer a familiar solution for Web developers.
* Improve tooling and developer experience to make WebAssembly accessible to a broader audience.
* Be a viable solution for non-web use cases (i.e. serverless, blockchain, etc...).

# Governance

AssemblyScript utilizes the governance model of a **BDFL**, as described in the [definitions described in opensource.guide](https://opensource.guide/leadership-and-governance/#what-are-some-of-the-common-governance-structures-for-open-source-projects). Daniel Wirtz, the original author of AssemblyScript, acts as the project's lead. For the time being, the BDFL strives to collect experience from applying the **Liberal contribution** model more often, emphasizing that development towards broader community influence is welcome, while acting as a failsafe device in case of disagreement along the way. The next planned revision of the governance model is the compiler's first stable release (most likely after integration with Wasm GC, as it is expected to require major disruptive changes).

# Community group

The [Community Group](https://github.com/AssemblyScript/community-group) is for those who would like to discuss with other community members (including members of the core team) using AssemblyScript in their applications or otherwise interested in becoming involved. Its goal is to communicate core feature requests and use cases to aid in prioritizing the core team's efforts, which can help reduce duplicating efforts amongst the community, and allow the community to be collectively more productive!

**Getting Involved:**

* Read and agree to the [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
* Join the [AssemblyScript Discord](https://discord.com/assemblyscript).
* Join one of our upcoming meetings (see the **#events** channel) and say "hi" :)
