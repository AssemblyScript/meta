# Goals

The goals of the AssemblyScript Working Group are:

* Target feature parity with WebAssembly and related technology.
* Support non-browser use cases well (i.e. serverless, blockchain, etc...).
* Stay backwards-compatible to TypeScript syntax and JavaScript APIs as much as possible and reasonable.
* Complement current web projects, and support building WebAssembly modules "from scratch". By offering "fine-grain" control to developers.
* Focus on developer experience, and try to be a great language for new and existing web developers. 

# Governance

Following the [definitions described in opensource.guide](https://opensource.guide/leadership-and-governance/#what-are-some-of-the-common-governance-structures-for-open-source-projects), governance is split into two parts:

## Technical Decisions

Technical Decisions can be interpreted as contributions being made to projects in the AssemblyScript Github Organization.

For this, we will be following BDFL. Daniel Wirtz (@dcodeIO) is the designated project lead. Thus, in the case there is conflict between contributors, the lead will be the one to make the final decision.

## Organizational Decisions

Organizational Descisions can be interpreted as contributions to the general project direction, goals, roadmap, maintainers, etc...

For this, we will be following a meritocracy. Where consensus will be requested on issues opened on this repo to get a community vote, and can find a path going forward.

# Groups

The AssemblyScript project has meetings and and correspondance divided into groups. These groups communicate and work together very closely, and provides a way for focused discussions for those who need that.

## Working Group

The working group is for those who would like to contribute to the project directly. Whether that be through getting advice on technical implementations, showing off a new tool they are building, or just generally talking about the AssemblyScript project and where it is headed.

**Anyone working on anything related to the AssemblyScript project is welcome to participate in the Working Group!**

## Community Group

The [community group](https://github.com/AssemblyScript/community-group) is for those who would like to discuss with other community members (including members of the working group) using AssemblyScript in their applications. The goal being that they can prioritize their core feature requests and use cases and communicate that to the working group. Which can help reduce duplicating efforts amongst the community, and allow the community to be collectively more productive!

# Teams

The AssemblyScript Working Group is divided into teams. The teams make design, architectural, and organizational decisions for their relevant domains and repositories by consensus. If consensus can't be made, then the project lead may act as a tie-breaker.

**Membership guidelines**:

* Anyone who is making significant contributions to the project (whether it be code, documentation, outreach, etc...) in the domains associated with the Working Group is welcome to join and request to join a team! :)
* Membership does not require any required responsibilities outside of general activity in the respective domain. The project is open source and contributions are made at one's own accord. So help when you can. If things get busy on a member's end, that is okay! We welcome back all awesome contributors after a haitus.
* All members of a team must adhere to the [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
* Membership does not imply commit access to a repository. Commit access should be handled by the maintainer of the repository, or by consensus of the respective team.

## Compiler

The Compiler team works directly on the AssemblyScript compiler and its standard library, mostly under the [AssemblyScript/assemblyscript](https://github.com/AssemblyScript/assemblyscript) repository.

* **Aaron Turner** (@torch2424) - Regular Contributor, [Fastly](https://www.fastly.com/)

## Advocate

The Advocate team works on projects, demos, talks, giving feedback on "messaging" about the project, and writing articles to help grow popularity and improve outreach.
